    "\n",
    "### üéØ What is a Prompt and Why Engineer Them?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:** The instruction or input given to a language model to generate a response. It's the primary way to communicate with models like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Engineering:** The craft of designing structured, context-aware instructions to guide AI models to produce useful, high-quality, and creative outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance:** The quality of an LLM's output is directly dependent on the quality of the input prompt. Even powerful models require clear directions to produce desired results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üèóÔ∏è Prompt Structuring: Four Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component | Purpose | Example |\n",
    "|-----------|---------|---------||\n",
    "| **Role** | Assigns specific persona/character | \"You are a travel blogger\" |\n",
    "| **Instruction** | Core task or goal to accomplish | \"Summarize this text\" |\n",
    "| **Input** | Context, data, or specific information | Resume, job description, paragraph |\n",
    "| **Output Format** | How final result should be delivered | \"Reply in bullet points\", \"JSON format\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Challenge: \"Loss in the Middle\"\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs tend to pay more attention to the **beginning** and **end** of long prompts, often skimming or ignoring instructions placed in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation Strategies:**\n",
    "- **Place Critical Instructions Early:** Put most important task at the very beginning\n",
    "- **Repeat Key Points at End:** Restate main instruction at the end\n",
    "- **Use Clear Formatting:** Employ bullet points, numbered lists, or bolding\n",
    "- **Break Down Long Prompts:** Use series of smaller, sequential prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üé® Prompt Crafting: The Art of Wording\n",
    "\n",
    "Crafting involves refining *how* you ask something to guide the model's tone, style, and depth:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clarity & Conciseness:** Be direct, remove ambiguity, use active language\n",
    "- **Specificity:** Provide clear boundaries (audience, intent, format)\n",
    "- **Tone & Style:** Control how the model sounds (friendly, formal, playful)\n",
    "- **Depth & Constraints:** Manage detail level (word limits, step-by-step)\n",
    "- **Intent Framing:** Guide *how to think* about a task\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Core Prompting Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Zero-Shot Prompting\n",
    "- **Description:** Task without examples, relies on pre-trained knowledge\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Simple, direct tasks like \"Translate this sentence to French\"\n",
    "- **Limitations:** Unpredictable performance for complex tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One-Shot Prompting\n",
    "- **Description:** Single example of input-output pair provided\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Helps model understand expected format or style\n",
    "- **Limitations:** May not be sufficient for complex reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Few-Shot Prompting\n",
    "- **Description:** 2-5 examples to help model learn the pattern\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Improves performance on complex or subtle tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Role-Based Prompting\n",
    "- **Description:** AI assigned specific role (career counselor, teacher)\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Expert advice, controlling tone, running simulations\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìä Few-Shot vs Role-Based Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Few-Shot | Role-Based |\n",
    "|--------|----------|------------|\n",
    "| **Purpose** | Teach pattern with examples | Guide behavior by assigning role |\n",
    "| **Style** | Example-driven | Persona-driven |\n",
    "| **Best For** | Clear patterns (translation, classification) | Expert advice, tone control, simulations |\n",
    "| **Strength** | Learns structure from minimal examples | Adds depth, context, and realism |\n",
    "| **When to Use** | Need to teach task format | Need domain knowledge or specific persona |\n",
    "| **Can Combine?** | Yes - more powerful when used together | Yes - role + examples = optimal output |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÑ Dynamic Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Prompts automatically generated or modified based on real-time inputs or changing context, rather than being static.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it Works:** Uses code logic or templates with variables filled based on user input or other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases:**\n",
    "- **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants:** Prompts change based on conversation history\n",
    "- **Personalized Experiences:** Filled with user-specific data (past purchases, preferences)\n",
    "- **Multi-Step Tasks (Chaining):** Output of one prompt becomes input for next\n",
    "- **Applications with Prompt Templates:** Apps use templates with variables (`[role]`, `[input]`, `[format]`)\n"
